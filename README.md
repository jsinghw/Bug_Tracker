# Bug_Tracker

##Overview

This is a basic internal tool meant to help keep track of support tickets or bugs in the system. When a ticket is first introduced it is placed in new until someone claims the ticket and is moved to in progress. Then the person looking into the ticket can either invalidate the ticket if they think nothing is wrong or complete the ticket.
